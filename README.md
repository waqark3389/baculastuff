# baculastuff

baculabefore.sh - clean/remove old bacula volumes which have passed the retention periods - its a (good) policy of bacula to never remove disk volumes. This script also notes down the start time of a job so we can work how how long the full process takes.

afterjob.sh - use the noted time in the baculabefore.sh script to work out time taken.

More to be added....
